# nano-zip2tar
Yes, I know, there are many Python packages or scripts which already convert zip
to tar.

The purpose of this project is to do it only with stdlib and **not** to be a
proper Python pacakge, but rather a one file script which can be easily
downloaded and used by anyone.

One of the use cases is to run it on limited CI or build environments where
using Python and downloading one file is possible, but installing packages with
pip is not.
